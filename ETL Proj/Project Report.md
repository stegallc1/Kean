## Project Report

At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:

* **E**xtract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc). – HTML Table from webpage into python for cleaning.  Dataset 2 was pulled from a SQL query from SQL Database of company operating system.


* **T**ransform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.- In python the majority of the time was cleaning misaligned columns and rows caused by several row & col spans.  Also, there was a lot of filtering and dropping of data that was no needed for analysis.

* **L**oad: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen. – Both data sources were put into pgadmin and going to be loaded into quickdatabasediagrams.com to show relationships.  But in our real world roles we felt the need to load into Power Bi for not only relationship analysis but visual building as well.  Data sets could be exported from python to csv docs(easy way out) or pushed to pgadmin and connected with or without the ODBC and finally python code put directly into Power Bi.  We completed using both python and pgadmin connections (one for each).
