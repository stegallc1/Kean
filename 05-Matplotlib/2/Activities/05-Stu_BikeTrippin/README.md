# Bike Trippin'

## Instructions


* Open the [starter file](Unsolved/bike_trippin.ipynb) and follow the prompts to import, split, and summarize the community bike dataset.

* Create a bar chart using Pandas and Matplotlib that visualizes how many individual bike trips were taken by each gender.

* Create a pie graph using Pandas and Matplotlib that can be used to visualize the trip duration of a single bike split up by gender.

## Hint

There is a buggy value stored within the `gender` column of the original DataFrame. In order to create an accurate chart, this value will need to be found and removed.
